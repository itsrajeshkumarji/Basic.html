        Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire sold 
        motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers and stationary engines which they had manufactured. Enfield Cycle Company also 
        used the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal". The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. 
        The Enfield Cycle Company is responsible for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet,
         the longest-lived motorcycle design in history. Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette 
         in 1967, which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until their closure in early 1971. Enfield's 
         remaining motorcycle business became part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business eventually closing in 
         1978.

    <td>After the Indian Independence Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its army to 
        patrol the country's border. In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike for the job.
         In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with
          Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet
           motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could 
           manufacture components.[7] By 1962, all components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960
            engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc
             and 500 cc models, along with several different models for different market segments.[8]</td>
